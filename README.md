# Indian_LegalText_Classification_Using_InLegalBERT

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, effective legal data processing and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have become pivotal. This project centers around the utilization of InLegalBERT, a model designed for superior performance in the legal domain. Specifically, it focuses on leveraging the ISS dataset to assign specified labels to sentences within legal documents.

Key Components and Findings:

Model Features: InLegalBERT exhibits advanced comprehension of legal semantics through extensive training on a large dataset of Indian legal content.
Dataset Utilization: The ISS dataset, structured and standardized, ensures minimal bias in the model system. It is label-encoded for seamless integration into the InLegalBERT system, enhancing its efficiency.
Training and Evaluation: The project involves fine-tuning InLegalBERT on the Indian legal text dataset, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results: The model demonstrates a balanced performance, offering valuable insights into legal text classification tasks. Validation accuracy of 72.44% showcases its effectiveness across diverse legal categories.
Future Enhancements: The project envisions the future application of InLegalBERT, suggesting potential advancements such as multimodal features, integration into legal chatbots, sentiment analysis on legal texts, statute identification, and semantic segmentation for rhetorical role identification in legal judgments.
Conclusion:
This project underscores InLegalBERT's significant impact on legal text classification, providing a powerful tool for legal professionals, researchers, and developers. The findings showcase its potential for improving legal information retrieval, document classification, and automation of legal research processes.
